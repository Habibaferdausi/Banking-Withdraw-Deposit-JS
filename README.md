# Banking-Withdraw-Deposit

Banking-Withdraw-Deposit using JavaScript and DOM is a simple project that allows users to deposit and withdraw money from a virtual bank account. This project uses JavaScript to handle the user input and DOM manipulation to display the account balance and transaction history.

To build this project, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
